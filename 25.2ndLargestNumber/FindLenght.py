Question :
==========
    To find the lenght of an array using slicing methodogy
Input :
=======
    Unsorted Integer Array 
Output:
=======
    Count the No of Element in the Array
Algorithm:
==========
    1.Initialize the Cout variable to 0
    2.Using the array Slicing concepts each and every element in an array is taken using While loop and the Count is incremented by 1
    3.print the count variable 
Code:
=====
def FindLenght(array):
    count = 0
    while(a[count:]):
        count += 1    
    return count
